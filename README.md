# Retinal-Vascular-Disease-Detection-using-Fundus-Image-ML-DL-
This project uses InceptionV3 with Keras and TensorFlow to classify diabetic retinopathy into five categories. It leverages a pretrained model for better performance and evaluates it using ROC curves. An interactive Gradio interface is developed for easy testing with fundus images.
